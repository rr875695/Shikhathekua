              The name "Thekua" comes from the process of making it - "thek" means to press or shape, 
              which refers to the traditional method of shaping the dough into beautiful patterns using 
              wooden molds or by hand.

            <h2>Cultural Importance in Bihar</h2>
            <p>
              Thekua is more than just a sweet in Bihar - it's a symbol of tradition, culture, and 
              togetherness. It represents the rich culinary heritage of Bihar and is often associated

              The traditional method of making Thekua involves using pure ingredients like wheat flour, 
              jaggery or sugar, and ghee, making it not just delicious but also nutritious. The art of

            <h2>Traditional Preparation</h2>
            <p>
              The traditional preparation of Thekua involves kneading wheat flour with jaggery or sugar 
              and ghee to form a smooth dough. The dough is then shaped into various forms - sometimes 
              using wooden molds with intricate designs, and sometimes shaped by hand into simple forms. 
              These are then deep-fried in ghee until golden brown and crispy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The process is often accompanied by prayers and traditional songs, making it a spiritual 
              and cultural experience that goes beyond just cooking.
